I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide an actual MP3 file. However, I can guide you on how to create one.

To create a sample MP3 file for Song 2, you can use an audio editing tool like Audacity, GarageBand, or any other audio editing software. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Open your audio editing software**: Download and install Audacity if you don't have it already.

2. **Import or record audio**: 
   - If you have an existing song, you can import it into the software.
   - If you want to record a new clip, use the recording feature in the software.

3. **Select a 10-30 second clip**: 
   - Use the selection tool to highlight a 10-30 second portion of the song.
   - Make sure the clip is representative and suitable for testing playback functionality.

4. **Export the clip as MP3**:
   - Go to `File` > `Export` > `Export as MP3`.
   - Choose the desired quality settings (128 kbps is usually sufficient for a sample).
   - Save the file as `song2.mp3`.

5. **Place the file in the correct directory**:
   - Move the `song2.mp3` file to the `public/songs/` directory of your project.

If you need a sample MP3 file for testing and don't have access to audio editing software, you can find free sample MP3 files online from websites that offer royalty-free music. Just make sure to comply with any licensing requirements.
