I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide an actual MP3 file. However, I can guide you on how to create a short audio clip for testing purposes.

1. **Choose a Song**: Select a song that you have the rights to use.
2. **Audio Editing Software**: Use software like Audacity (free) or any other audio editing tool.
3. **Create a Clip**:
   - Open the song in the audio editor.
   - Select a 10-30 second segment of the song.
   - Export this segment as an MP3 file.

4. **Save the File**: Name the file `song2.mp3` and place it in the `public/songs/` directory of your project.

Here is a step-by-step guide using Audacity:

1. **Download and Install Audacity**: If you don't have it, download it from [Audacity's official website](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
2. **Open Audacity**: Launch the application.
3. **Import the Song**:
   - Go to `File` > `Import` > `Audio...`
   - Select the song file you want to use.
4. **Select the Segment**:
   - Use the selection tool to highlight a 10-30 second segment of the song.
5. **Export the Clip**:
   - Go to `File` > `Export` > `Export Selected Audio...`
   - Choose `MP3 Files` as the format.
   - Name the file `song2.mp3` and save it.

6. **Move the File**: Place the `song2.mp3` file in the `public/songs/` directory of your project.

This will create a short MP3 clip that you can use for testing playback functionality.
