I'm unable to create or upload actual audio files. However, you can create a short MP3 file using audio editing software like Audacity or online tools. Here are the steps to create a sample MP3 file:

1. **Record or Obtain Audio**: Use a microphone to record a short clip or find a royalty-free music clip online.
2. **Edit the Clip**: Use software like Audacity to trim the audio to the desired length (10-30 seconds).
3. **Export as MP3**: Export the edited audio clip as an MP3 file.

Once you have the MP3 file, you can place it in the `public/songs/` directory and name it `song1.mp3`.
