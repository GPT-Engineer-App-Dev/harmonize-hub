Binary files like MP3s cannot be created or represented in text form. To fulfill your request, you would need to upload an actual MP3 file to the specified directory. 

If you need a sample MP3 file, you can create one using audio editing software or download a royalty-free sample from the internet. Once you have the file, you can place it in the `public/songs/` directory and name it `song1.mp3`.

If you need further assistance with creating or obtaining a sample MP3 file, please let me know!
